This library provides objects that model probability distributions and the
related operations that are common in generative Bayesian modeling and Bayesian
inference, including Gibbs sampling and variational mean field algorithms. The
file `abstractions.py` describes the queries a distribution must support to be
used in each algorithm, as well as an API for models, which compose the
distribution objects.

The file `models.py` shows how to construct mixture models building on the
distribution objects in this library. For example, to generate data from a
Gaussian mixture model, we might set some hyperparameters, construct a
`Mixture` object, and then ask it to randomly generate some data from the
prior:

```python
import numpy as np
from pybasicbayes import models, distributions

# hyperparameters
alpha_0=5.0
obs_hypparams = dict(mu_0=np.zeros(2),sigma_0=np.eye(2),kappa_0=0.05,nu_0=5)

# create the model
priormodel = models.Mixture(alpha_0=alpha_0,
        components=[distributions.Gaussian(**obs_hypparams) for itr in range(30)])

# generate some data
data = priormodel.rvs(400)

# delete the model
del priormodel
```

If we throw away the prior model at the end, we're left just with the data,
which look like this:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
plt.plot(data[:,0],data[:,1],'kx')
plt.title('data')
```

Imagine we loaded these data from some measurements file and we wanted to fit a
mixture model to it. We can create a new `Mixture` and run inference to get a
representation of the posterior distribution over mixture models conditioned on
observing these data:

```python
posteriormodel = models.Mixture(alpha_0=alpha_0,
        components=[distributions.Gaussian(**obs_hypparams) for itr in range(30)])

posteriormodel.add_data(data)
```

Since pybasicbayes implements both Gibbs sampling and variational mean field
inference algorithms, we can use both together in a hybrid algorithm.

```python
import copy
from pybasicbayes.util import progprint_xrange

allscores = [] # variational lower bounds on the marginal data log likelihood
allmodels = []
for superitr in range(5):
    # Gibbs sampling to wander around the posterior
    print 'Gibbs Sampling'
    for itr in progprint_xrange(100):
        posteriormodel.resample_model()

    # mean field to lock onto a mode
    print 'Mean Field'
    scores = [posteriormodel.meanfield_coordinate_descent_step()
                for itr in progprint_xrange(100)]

    allscores.append(scores)
    allmodels.append(copy.deepcopy(posteriormodel))

import operator
models_and_scores = sorted([(m,s[-1]) for m,s
    in zip(allmodels,allscores)],key=operator.itemgetter(1),reverse=True)
```

Now we can plot the score trajectories:

```python
plt.figure()
for scores in allscores:
    plt.plot(scores)
plt.title('model vlb scores vs iteration')
```

![model vlb scores vs iteration](http://www.mit.edu/~mattjj/github/pybasicbayes/scores.png)

And show the point estimate of the best model by calling the convenient `Mixture.plot()`:

```python
models_and_scores[0][0].plot()
plt.title('best model')
```

![best fit model and data](http://www.mit.edu/~mattjj/github/pybasicbayes/fit.png)

Since these are Bayesian methods, we have much more than just a point estimate
for plotting: we have fit entire distributions, so we can query any confidence
or marginal that we need.

See the file `demo.py` for the code for this demo.
